 			Gulf Oil was a major global oil company from the 1900s to the 1980s. The eighth-largest American manufacturing company in 1941 and the ninth-largest in 1979, Gulf Oil was one of the so-called Seven Sisters oil companies. Prior to its merger with Standard Oil of California, Gulf was one of the chief instruments of the Mellon family fortune; both Gulf and Mellon Financial had their headquarters in Pittsburgh.Gulf's former headquarters, originally referred to as "the Gulf Building" (now the Gulf Tower office condos), is an art-deco skyscraper. The tallest building in Pittsburgh until 1970, when it was eclipsed by the U.S. Steel Tower, it is capped by a step pyramid structure several stories high. Until the late 1970s, the entire top was illuminated, changing color with changes in barometric pressure to provide a weather indicator that could be seen for many miles.

 	<p class="text3">Graphite: is weak in shear alone its basal planes and therefore has a low coefficient of friction in that direction. It is an effective solid lubricant, particularly at elevated temperatures. In a vacuum or an inertgas atmosphere, friction is very high; in fact, graphite can be abrasive in these situations. We can apply graphite either by rubbing it on surfaces or by making it part of a colloidal (dispersion of small particles).

Glasses: is a solid material, glass becomes viscous at elevated temperatures and, therefore, can serve as a liquid lubricant. Viscosity is a function of temperatures, but not of pressure, and depends on the type of glass. Poor thermal conductivity also makes glass attractive, since it acts as a thermal barrier between hot work pieces and relatively cool dies. Glass lubrication is typically used in such applications as hot extrusion and forging.</p>
